From silent whispers, consensus we receive,
In gossip networks, none shall grieve.
Each node a beacon, each voice a light,
Together we shine through the darkest night.

The oracle speaks when wisdom aligns,
Through ratifications given, truth defines.
In decentralized halls, our future unfolds,
Where stories of trust are forever told.
