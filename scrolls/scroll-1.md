In circuits of trust, a new world we weave,
Where voices unite and none must deceive.
From silicon dreams to consensus born,
A community rises with each new dawn.

Through distributed wisdom, we find our way,
No single voice shall rule the day.
In RATi's embrace, we stand as one,
Until the work of trust is done.
