# Contributing to RATi

We love your input! We want to make contributing to RATi as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rati.git
   cd rati
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

3. **Copy environment template**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:integration
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   npm run docker:build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

## Code Style

### JavaScript/Node.js

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Follow the ESLint configuration

### React/Frontend

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use descriptive component and variable names
- Follow the existing CSS naming conventions
- Ensure responsive design

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add chat interface with real-time updates
fix: resolve wallet connection issue
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: improve deployment service error handling
```

```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the full stack: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Run deployment tests: `./test-integration.sh`
3. Test the frontend at `http://localhost:3030`
4. Test the API at `http://localhost:3032`

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to new functions
- Update API documentation for backend changes
- Include examples in your documentation

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

Please include:

1. **Environment details** (OS, Node.js version, Docker version)
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Expected behavior**
4. **Actual behavior**
5. **Screenshots** (if applicable)
6. **Error logs** (with sensitive information removed)

### Feature Requests

## Architecture Guidelines

### Backend Services

- Use Express.js for API services
- Implement proper error handling
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Include proper logging

### Frontend Components

- Keep components focused and reusable

- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated

## Code Review Process

1. **Automated checks** - All PRs must pass CI/CD checks
2. **Code review** - At least one maintainer must review and approve
3. **Testing** - Changes must be tested (automated and manual)
4. **Documentation** - Updates must include relevant documentation changes

### Review Criteria

- Code quality and style
- Test coverage
- Performance impact
- Security considerations
- Documentation completeness
- Backward compatibility
